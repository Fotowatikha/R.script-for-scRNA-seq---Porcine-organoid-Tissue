# Finding cell to cell communication using CellChat

###### PREPERATION DATA TISSUE ########

#### Open the saved Seurat file with annotation information (not working with Seurat_v5)
sobj.org <- LoadH5Seurat("/Users/hamid/Desktop/ABG MSc project/Raw data/Ileum tissue/Wiarda - Ileum Tissue (non-immune)/WGCNA/ileum_pig_org.v4.WGCNA.h5seurat")


#### Open the saved Seurat by renaming saved object, because we cannot use LoadH5Seurat due imcompatibility with v_5
sobj.org <- sobj1 # contains no secretory prog
Idents(sobj.org) <- "cellID" # Set the ident of the metadata to the one of interest (in this case our cellIDs)
sobj.org$cellID <- factor(sobj.org$cellID, levels = c('Prolific Stem/Prog', 'Prolific TAC', 'TAC', 'Early EC Prog', 'Late EC Prog', "PC", "GC", "EEC", 'Renewing EC', 'Developing EC', 'Undeveloped EC', 'Early Immature EC', 'Late Immature EC', 'Migrating EC (Villous Tips)', 'Semi-Mature EC', 'Resting Cells')) # order accordingly

#### Update gene names to human homologs as cellchat uses human (and mouse database) 
# Get human and pig genes
human.genes = useMart("ensembl", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl", host = "https://dec2021.archive.ensembl.org/") # Dec 2021 is latest
pig.genes = useMart("ensembl", dataset = "sscrofa_gene_ensembl", host = "https://dec2021.archive.ensembl.org/")
# Find pig Homologous genes
annot_table <- getLDS(mart = human.genes, attributes = c('ensembl_gene_id','hgnc_symbol','external_gene_name','chromosome_name'), martL = pig.genes, attributesL = c('ensembl_gene_id','external_gene_name','chromosome_name','gene_biotype'))
# Get the Ensembl ID to be converted to human
ENS <- rownames(sobj.org@assays$RNA@features)[c(grep("ENS", rownames(sobj.org)))]
# find the orthologs
orthologs <- getLDS(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "external_gene_name"), filters = "ensembl_gene_id", 
    values = ENS, mart = pig.genes, attributesL = c("hgnc_symbol", "ensembl_gene_id"), martL = human.genes)
# Find the positions of our Seurat ENSEMBL ids in the orthologs output
ENSEMBL_IDs.pos <- na.omit(c(match(c(paste(ENS)), orthologs$Gene.stable.ID))) # and remove NAs (ENS with no gene IDs)
# Now find the GeneIDs in orthologs using the ENSEMBL_IDs.pos
geneIDs <- orthologs$HGNC.symbol[ENSEMBL_IDs.pos] 
# Since not all ENSEMBL_IDs have true gene name, we need to find the index of geneIDs with no gene name and remove their corresponding ENSEMBL_IDs
# To do this, we will remove genes with no names, and then find the index of these genesID in orthologs in order to find the corresponding ENSEMBL ids
geneIDs <- as.character(geneIDs[geneIDs !=""])
# Ensure that we don't replace ENSEMBL ids with gene names that could result in duplicates
duplicates <- generics::intersect(geneIDs, rownames(sobj.org)) # find duplicated between new gene-ids with existing ones in the Seurat object
duplicates.pos <- c(match(c(paste(duplicates)), geneIDs)) # Find position of the duplicate
geneIDs <- geneIDs[-duplicates.pos] # and remove the duplicate

geneIDs.pos <- c(match(c(paste(geneIDs)), orthologs$HGNC.symbol)) # find position of gene IDs in them
ENSEMBL_IDs <- orthologs$Gene.stable.ID[geneIDs.pos] # find the ENSEMBL_IDs using the positions of the gene IDs
# Now we have found all the ENSEMBL ids that have a annotated gene name (winch are also found in our Seurat object)
# We will their final positions in our Seurat object and finally replace them with the true gene ID
# NOTE: The order of the genes are conserved using the method above
final.pos <- c(match(c(paste(ENSEMBL_IDs)), rownames(sobj.org)))
# replace the name of that genes for all slots
rownames(sobj.org@assays$RNA@features)[c(final.pos)] <- c(paste(geneIDs))

#### Maming a CellChat object from our Seurat file
# Take the normalized gene counts from the seurat obj
data.input <- GetAssayData(sobj.org, assay = "RNA", slot = "data") 
# Extract the metadat form seurat obj
labels <- Idents(sobj.org)
meta <- data.frame(group = labels, row.names = names(labels)) 
# Make cellchat obj using the previous information
cellchat.org <- createCellChat(object = data.input, meta = meta, group.by = "group")
#cellChat <- createCellChat(object = sobj, group.by = "cellID", assay = "RNA") # alternative without using previous steps

#### Loading in the human CellChat database for ligand-receptor interactions
# Load Human database
CellChatDB <- CellChatDB.human
# Show the categories in the human database
showDatabaseCategory(CellChatDB)

#### Analysis
# We must use either a subset of CellChatDB for cell-cell communication analysis or the full CellChatDB
# This depends on user interest, and one example is given below with subsetting interactions related to "Secreted Signaling"
#CellChatDB.use <- subsetDB(CellChatDB, search = "Secreted Signaling", key = "annotation") # use Secreted Signaling only
CellChatDB.use <- CellChatDB # Or use the default full CellChatDB
# We now set the used database in the Cellchat object
cellchat.org@DB <- CellChatDB.use

# Now we will subset the expression data to only continue the analysis with the our genes that are expressed and found in the Cellchat database (DB slot). This will will also add a new slow "data.signaling" to our Cellchat object that contains the genes we use in the downstream analysis
# This will also significantly reduce the RAM usage
cellchat.org <- subsetData(cellchat.org) # do the subsetting as described above

# Set the number of cores to be used (OPTIONAL, be careful with you computer!!!)
#future::plan("multisession", workers = 4) 
# Pre-processing the expression data
cellchat.org <- identifyOverExpressedGenes(cellchat.org) # identify the over expressed genes form the genes in the "data.signaling" slot
cellchat.org <- identifyOverExpressedInteractions(cellchat.org) # do the same for the interactions

### OPTIONAL ###
# project gene expression data onto protein-protein-interaction (Optional: when running it, USER should set `raw.use = FALSE` in the function `computeCommunProb()` in order to use the projected data)
# This function is useful when analyzing single-cell data with shallow sequencing depth because the projection reduces the dropout effects of signaling genes, in particular for possible zero expression of subunits of ligands/receptors.
cellchat.org <- projectData(cellchat.org, PPI.human) # this will add a new "data.project" slot

# Now we will compute the communication probability and determine(estimate) cellular communication network
# It calculates that genes must be expressed by at least 25% in each cell type. we can deviate from the default 25% by adding type = "truncatedMean" and set trim = 0.1 for 15%.
# Parameter values are stored in "object@options$parameter"
#cellchat.org <- computeCommunProb(cellchat.org, type = "truncatedMean", trim = 0.20) # use this code if the line above was skipped (not run by user)
cellchat.org <- computeCommunProb(cellchat.org, type = "truncatedMean", trim = 0.15, raw.use = FALSE, ) # raw.use = FALSE to use the projected data from the "data.project" slot

# Filter out the cell-cell communication if there are only few number of cells in certain cell groups
# Since we have EEC cells with n<4 in organoid and limited number of cells in tissue, we set this value to 5
cellchat.org <- filterCommunication(cellchat.org, min.cells = 5)

# Now we computes the communication probability on signaling pathway level by summarizing the communication probabilities of all ligands-receptors interactions associated with each signaling pathway.
# The determined intercellular communication network of each ligand-receptor pair and each signaling pathway is stored in the slot "net" and "netP"
cellchat.org <- computeCommunProbPathway(cellchat.org) # we identified 87 pathways for ileum tissue that are significant when using human PPI and 44 when not using human PPI
cellchat.org@netP[["pathways"]] # to check the pathways that were found to be significant.
length(cellchat.org@netP[["pathways"]]) # 87 found

# Now we calculate the aggregated cell-cell communication network by counting the number of links or summarizing the communication probability and visualize it in a plot. We can also only aggregate the celltypes of interest
cellchat.org <- aggregateNet(cellchat.org) # under the Net slot, we have not calculated the weight and count of each interaction
# The count and weights of the communications can be seen here:
cellchat.org@net$count
cellchat.org@net$weight

# Plot aggregated cell-cell communication network showing the number of interactions or the total interaction strength (weights) between any two cell groups using circle plot.
groupSize <- as.numeric(table(cellchat.org@idents)) # make the n number of cells per celltype as numeric

######################### plot all interactions by weight or number for all cell types #########################

#netVisual_circle(cellchat@net$count, vertex.weight = groupSize, weight.scale = T, label.edge= F, title.name = "N Interactions - Ileum Tiss")
#netVisual_circle(cellchat@net$weight, vertex.weight = groupSize, weight.scale = T, label.edge= F, title.name = "Interaction Strength - Ileum Tiss")

######################### plot all interactions by weight (or number) for individual cell types ######################### 
# instead of aggregated examination of cell cell communication, we can also check per celltype
# Lets see the strength of communication per cell type by looping 
mat <- cellchat.org@net$weight 
for (i in 1:nrow(mat)) { # loop in number of rows (number of cell types)
  mat2 <- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(mat), ncol = ncol(mat), dimnames = dimnames(mat))
  mat2[i, ] <- mat[i, ]
  netVisual_circle(mat2, vertex.weight = groupSize, weight.scale = T, edge.weight.max = max(mat), title.name = rownames(mat)[i])
}

# Now we want to check pathways are found by the model
cellchat.org@netP$pathways
# Now we extract and show the individual genes and ligand-receptor that are contributing to the communication network (pathways) that we previously found
# This code is just for visualization
